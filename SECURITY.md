## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Never commit environment variables to Git**
2. **Use different keys for development and production**
3. **Regularly update dependencies**
4. **Review code for security issues**
5. **Test authentication flows thoroughly**

### For Deployment
1. **Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard**
2. **Configure CORS properly in Supabase**
3. **Enable RLS on all tables**
4. **Use HTTPS in production**
5. **Monitor for security issues**

### For Users
1. **Use strong passwords**
2. **Enable two-factor authentication if available**
3. **Log out when using shared devices**
4. **Report security issues immediately**

## Security Contacts

If you discover a security vulnerability:
1. **Do not create a public issue**
2. **Contact the development team privately**
3. **Provide detailed information about the issue**
4. **Allow time for investigation and fix**
